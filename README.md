# MotiFi · Personalized Finance SaaS Platform

Hi 👋 Welcome to **MotiFi** — the intelligent finance platform that believes:

MotiFi helps you align your spending with your values, mood, and life goals — because budgeting shouldn’t feel like punishment.  
Think of it as **financial wellness** with a side of motivation, all wrapped in a modern web + mobile experience.

On a more serious note, **MotiFi** is an intelligent personal finance platform designed to help users align their financial habits with their life goals and emotional well-being. It blends budgeting, behavioral tracking, and AI-enhanced coaching into one cohesive experience.
